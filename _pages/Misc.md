Some random facts:

My Chinese name is 江俊岐, pronounced as 江Jiang 俊June 岐Chee (? somewhat). 

I was born and raised in Beijing, China, while having a family origin in Jiayu, Hubei, a small town south to Wuhan. 

I have been playing Saxophone since I was 8, both classical in orchestras and Jazz for fun. 

When I am listening to music, for more than 95% of the time I am listening to ZHOU Jielun / Jay Chou, but my one favorite song is *All of Me* by John Legend. 

I thought I would never study anything related to science and technology but, well, I am happy now. 

I love Edinburgh, it's the most lovely city and I encourage everyone to visit if possible. 

I enjoy cold weathers. 

I have suffered from the hot and humid weather in Guangzhou. 

I can understand Cantonese but I speak very little. 

I love Cantonese foods and, in fact, all Asian foods. 

Most often I make fried rice, then it's Chinese style teriyaki chicken. 

Me and my lovely wife Norah, we enjoy travelling around the world.

2 is greater than 1.
