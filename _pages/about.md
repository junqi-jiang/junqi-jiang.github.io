I am a PhD Computing Research Student (started April 2022) at the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) of [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by [Professor Francesca Toni](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ft/) and [Dr Francesco Leofante](https://fraleo.github.io/), funded by [the Interactive Explainable AI project](https://raeng.org.uk/programmes-and-prizes/programmes/meet-the-researchers/professor-francesca-toni). I'm also a TA at the Department of Computing and Imperial College Business School, helping with several AI / ML and programming courses. 

From June to December 2024, I'll intern at [J.P. Morgan AI Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) in London as an AI Research Associate.

My research interest spans the spectrum of AI trustworthiness, including its explainability, robustness, fairness, privacy, etc. I'm focusing on explainable AI and the robustness property of counterfactual explanations (algorithmic recourse). Other projects I'm currently working on include explainability for graph neural networks and deep learning for Formula 1 race strategy.

Previously, I completed my MSc Computing degree from Imperial in 2021, and I have two BEng degrees (2020), one from [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) where I did the last two years with a dissertation, and one from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) where I spent the first two years.
