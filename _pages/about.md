I am a PhD Computing Research Student (started April 2022) at the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) of [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by [Professor Francesca Toni](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ft/) and funded by [the Department and JP Morgan](https://raeng.org.uk/programmes-and-prizes/programmes/meet-the-researchers/professor-francesca-toni). My research focuses on explainable AI, and most recently on the robustness property of counterfactual explanations (algorithmic recourse). I'm also a TA at the department, helping with several AI / ML and programming courses. 

Previously, I completed my MSc Computing degree from Imperial in 2021, and I have two BEng degrees (2020) from [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) where I did the last two years with a dissertation, and [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) where I spent the first two years.
