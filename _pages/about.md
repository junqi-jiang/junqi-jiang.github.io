I am a PhD Computing Research student (2022.04-) at the [Computational Logic and Argumentation Group](https://clarg.doc.ic.ac.uk/), [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/computing/), [Imperial College London](), supervised by [Professor Francesca Toni](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ft/), fully funded by the Department and JP Morgan. My research currently focuses on explainable AI and counterfactual explanations.

I hold an [MSc Computing Science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/computing/computing/) degree with Distinction from Imperial (2021), and two BEng degrees (2020), one with First-Class Honours from [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), and one from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/).
