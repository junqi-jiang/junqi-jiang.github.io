I am a PhD Computing Research Student (started April 2022) at the [Computational Logic and Argumentation](https://clarg.doc.ic.ac.uk/) group at [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by [Professor Francesca Toni](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ft/) and [Dr Francesco Leofante](https://fraleo.github.io/), funded by [the Interactive Explainable AI project](https://raeng.org.uk/programmes-and-prizes/programmes/meet-the-researchers/professor-francesca-toni). I'm also a TA at the Department of Computing and Imperial College Business School, helping with several AI / ML and programming courses. 

From June to December 2024, I'm doing an internship as an AI Research Associate at J.P. Morgan [Explainable AI Center of Excellence](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/initiatives/explainable-ai-center-of-excellence), working with [Dr Tom Bewley](https://tombewley.com/) and [Dr Saumitra Mishra](https://sites.google.com/site/saumitramishrac4dm) on interpretability for large language models.

My research interest spans the spectrum of AI trustworthiness, including its explainability, robustness, fairness, privacy, etc. I'm focusing on counterfactual explanations (algorithmic recourse), robustness of explanations, and predictive multiplicity. I'm also involved in some applied projects like explainable graph neural networks for city planning and deep learning for Formula 1 race strategy.

Previously, I completed my MSc Computing degree from Imperial in 2021. I received two BEng degrees (2020) from [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) and [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/).
