I am a PhD Computing Research student (2022.04-) at the [Computational Logic and Argumentation Group](https://clarg.doc.ic.ac.uk/), [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/computing/), [Imperial College London](), supervised by (the amazing) [Prof. Francesca Toni](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ft/), fully funded by the Department and JP Morgan. My research currently focuses on explainable AI and counterfactual explanations.

Previously, I spent a few months as a full-time software development engineer at Huawei, Beijing. I hold a [MSc Computing Science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/computing/computing/) degree with Distinction from Imperial (2021), and two BEng degrees (2020), one with First-Class Honours from the University of Edinburgh, one from South China University of Technology.
