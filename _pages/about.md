I am a PhD Computer Science student (2022.04-) at the [Computational Logic and Argumentation Group](https://clarg.doc.ic.ac.uk/), [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/computing/), [Imperial College London](), supervised by (the amazing) [Prof. Francesca Toni](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ft/), and fully funded by the Department and JP Morgan. My research currently focuses on explainable AI and counterfactual explanations, I believe the current literature needs more attentions in Good Old-Fashioned AI.

Previously, I spent a few months as a full-time software development engineer at Huawei, Beijing. I obtained a [MSc Computing Science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/computing/computing/) degree with Distinction from Imperial (2021.10), a BEng Electrical and Mechanical Engineering degree First-Class from the University of Edinburgh (2020.07), and a BEng Mechatronic Engineering degree from South China University of Technology (2020.07).
