I am a PhD Computing Research student (April 2022 - ) at the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by [Professor Francesca Toni](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ft/) and funded by [the Department and JP Morgan](https://raeng.org.uk/programmes-and-prizes/programmes/meet-the-researchers/professor-francesca-toni). My research currently focuses on explainable AI and counterfactual explanations.

I hold an MSc Computing Science degree with Distinction from Imperial (2021), and two BEng degrees (2020), one with First-Class Honours from [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), and one from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/).
