I am a PhD Computer Science Student (started April 2022) at the [Computational Logic and Argumentation](https://clarg.doc.ic.ac.uk/) group at [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by [Professor Francesca Toni](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ft/) and [Dr Francesco Leofante](https://fraleo.github.io/), funded by [the Interactive Explainable AI project](https://raeng.org.uk/programmes-and-prizes/programmes/meet-the-researchers/professor-francesca-toni). From June to December 2024, I interned as an AI Research Associate at J.P. Morgan [Explainable AI Center of Excellence](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/initiatives/explainable-ai-center-of-excellence), working with [Dr Tom Bewley](https://tombewley.com/) and [Dr Saumitra Mishra](https://sites.google.com/site/saumitramishrac4dm).

My research interest spans the spectrum of AI trustworthiness, including explainable AI, mechanistic interpretability, robustness, fairness, privacy, etc. I have mostly worked on improving the quality of counterfactual explanations (for recourse purposes) by studying their robustness, and topics related to model multiplicity. I'm also interested in leveraging interpretability techniques for machine learning model evaluation and improvements. 

I'm involved in teaching and student supervision activities at Imperial. I'm also part of some applied projects like explainable graph neural networks for city planning and deep learning for Formula One race strategy.

Previously, I completed my MSc Computer Science degree from Imperial in 2021. I received two BEng degrees (2020) from [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) and [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/).
